# Zoomer Web Client

Frontend for Project Zoomer.

Project Zoomer allows ministry leaders to create Zoom meetings using a shared cluster of Zoom accounts, instead of provisioning accounts for each department.

This repo houses the React frontend for Project Zoomer. It mimics the Zoom web interface for setting up a meeting, to give users a familiar interface. Users can create and manage single and recurring meetings. Admins are able to access meetings created by other users.

This client talks directly to firebase for authentication and firestore. Only `@cogef.org` accounts are allowed to log in.
